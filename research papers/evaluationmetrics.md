## ⚙️ 1. Claim Approval Time Reduced by 70–80%

### 🎯 What it means:

ClaimSwift automates data collection, validation, and decision-making, which reduces the overall time taken from claim submission → settlement.

### 🧪 How to Evaluate:

| Step | Metric                  | How to Measure                                                                        | Tools                               |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1    | **Baseline time**       | Collect average approval time from public insurer data or mock workflow (manual flow) | Dataset or simulation logs          |
| 2    | **Automated flow time** | Record end-to-end execution time in ClaimSwift (agent logs: start → final decision)   | Python logging / Prometheus metrics |
| 3    | **Compare improvement** | `((Baseline - Automated) / Baseline) × 100`                                           | Simple Python script                |

### 📊 Example:

* Manual average claim approval = **10 days**
* ClaimSwift automated pipeline = **2 days**
  → **Reduction = (10 - 2) / 10 × 100 = 80% faster**

### 💡 Evaluation Tip:

Simulate at least **20–30 sample claims** of varying complexity and average the results.

## 🛡️ 2. Fraud Detection Accuracy Improved by 20–30%

### 🎯 What it means:

Your ML-based **Validation & Risk Assessment Agent** detects fraudulent claims more accurately than traditional rule-based methods.

### 🧪 How to Evaluate:

| Step | Metric                | How to Measure                                                                                                                         | Tools                      |
| ---- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1    | **Baseline accuracy** | Use rule-based fraud detection (existing insurer approach)                                                                             | Simulated decision logs    |
| 2    | **Model accuracy**    | Use ML classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, XGBoost, or LLM-based reasoning) trained on synthetic or public insurance fraud datasets | Scikit-learn / HuggingFace |
| 3    | **Metrics**           | Compare **Precision, Recall, F1-score** for fraud class                                                                                | scikit-learn metrics       |
| 4    | **Improvement**       | `(New Accuracy - Old Accuracy) / Old Accuracy × 100`                                                                                   | Jupyter Notebook           |

### 📊 Example:

* Rule-based accuracy = 70%
* ML-based accuracy = 90%
  → **Improvement = (90 - 70) / 70 × 100 = 28.6%**

### 💡 Evaluation Tip:

Use public datasets such as:

* **Auto Insurance Claim Fraud Dataset (Kaggle)**
* **Insurance Company Benchmark (COIL 2000)**

## 💰 3. Operational Cost Savings up to 30% per Claim

### 🎯 What it means:

Because ClaimSwift automates document processing, risk evaluation, and settlement initiation, insurers save on labor and process costs.

### 🧪 How to Evaluate:

| Step | Metric                      | How to Measure                                              | Tools                         |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1    | **Baseline cost per claim** | Include avg. labor cost + system cost for manual processing | Market data / insurer reports |
| 2    | **Automated cost**          | Measure compute + maintenance cost of ClaimSwift per claim  | AWS/GCP cost monitoring       |
| 3    | **Savings**                 | `(Baseline cost - Automated cost) / Baseline cost × 100`    | Simple spreadsheet analysis   |

### 📊 Example:

* Manual claim handling = ₹1,000 per claim (staff + admin)
* ClaimSwift automation cost = ₹700 per claim
  → **Savings = (1000 - 700)/1000 × 100 = 30%**

### 💡 Evaluation Tip:

Estimate costs for:

* Human claim assessors’ hourly wages
* API/compute usage (OCR, LLM calls, Vision model)
* Server cost per claim processed
