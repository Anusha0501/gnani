# Fraud Detection Guidelines

## Behavioral Red Flags
- Claim filed immediately after policy purchase.
- Multiple claims within short period (< 90 days).
- Inconsistent incident date vs FIR date.

## Document Red Flags
- Missing mandatory documents (FIR, estimate, photos).
- Edited or low-quality repair invoices.

## Financial Red Flags
- Claimed amount > 80% of sum insured.
- Repeated repair at non-network garages.

## Image-based Red Flags
- Tampered or duplicate vehicle images.
- Mismatched license plate numbers.

## Fraud Scoring (for automation)
- 0–30 : Low Risk
- 31–60 : Medium Risk
- 61–100 : High Risk (Escalate)
